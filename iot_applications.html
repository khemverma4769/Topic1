        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi, I am Khemraj Verma. As a student of B.E in Software Engineering at Chitkara University, I have a specialization in front-end development. I have gained a lot of experience working on Arduino-based projects and Raspberry Pi. I am continuously striving to enhance my skills in this field.</p>

        <h2>Activity 1</h2>
        <p>IoT (Internet of Things) app refers to a software application that is designed to interact with and control IoT devices. These apps typically run on smartphones or other mobile devices and use wireless communication protocols (such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) to connect to and control IoT devices in the home, office, or other environments. Some examples of IoT apps include smart home automation systems, connected lighting systems, smart thermostats, and wearable devices. The purpose of IoT apps is to provide a convenient and user-friendly interface for managing and controlling IoT devices and collecting and analyzing data from them.</p>

        <h2>Activity 2</h2>
        <p>A smart building is a building equipped with advanced technology systems that allow it to be highly energy efficient, secure, and comfortable for its occupants. These buildings use interconnected networks of sensors, cameras, and other devices to monitor and control various aspects of the building, such as lighting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, security, and energy usage.</p>

      <section id="all" class="mb-5">
        <h2>Activity 3</h2>
        <p>Control face refers to the interface or surface through which a person interacts with a control system. In the context of building automation, a control face could refer to the interface on a wall-mounted touch screen or mobile device through which a user interacts with a smart building control system to adjust lighting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and other building systems. A control face can also refer to physical buttons, switches, and dials on a control panel or device that allow a user to manually control various aspects of a system.</p>
